- 👋 Hi, I’m @FaizanAhmed48 and I'm a Junior Game Designer looking to secure a place in the Games or Tech industry.
- 👀 I’m interested in writing (I'm a published author and spoken word artist), wrestling and all things games! I love the complexity of design and building game systems in Excel and game engines like Clickteam Fusion (GameMaker) 
- 🌱 I’m currently improving my aptitude in HTML, C++ and learning 3D engines like Unity and Unreal to equip myself with contemporary skills of the industry.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making, designing for and making art for games.
- 📫 Best way to reach me is via my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/faizan-ahmed-91055822a/
